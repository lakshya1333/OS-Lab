This Lab contains PAGE REPLACEMENT ALGORITHMS .

Algorithms :
FIFO :
1. Start
2. Read the number of frames
3. Read the number of pages
4. Read the page numbers
5. Initialize the values in frames to -1
6. Allocate the pages in to frames in first in first out order.
7. Display the number of page faults.
8. stop
Optimal Page Replacement :
1. Start
2. Read the number of frames
3. Read the number of pages
4. Read the page numbers
5. Initialize the values in frames to -1
6. Replace the page that will not be used for the longest period of time.
7. Display the number of page faults.
8. stop.

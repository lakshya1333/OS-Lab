``DISK SCHEDULING ALGORITHM``

`TYPES OF DISK SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS`
Although there are other algorithms that reduce the seek time of all requests, we will
concentrate on the following disk scheduling algorithms:
a. First Come-First Serve (FCFS)
b. Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
c. Elevator (SCAN)
d. Circular SCAN (C-SCAN)
e. LOOK
f. C-LOOK


Lab Exercise :
1. Develop a menu driven program to simulate the following disk scheduling algorithms: SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, C-LOOK.
Additional Exercise :
1. Develop a menu driven program to simulate the following disk scheduling algorithms: FCFS, LOOK
